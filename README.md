# TPot-Project
This Azure honeypot project is a fake computer system/network that looks real but isn’t used for critical work. It’s designed to attract hackers who are up to no good. This project demonstrates skills in cloud infrastructure, network configuration, and security monitoring, while showcasing how attackers interact with exposed systems in the wild.
